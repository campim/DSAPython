Data Structures and Algorithms - python - Daniel G. Campos (2022)

**1. algorithm_bubble_simple.py :** simple bubble sort algorithm in python with an array of random generated numbers as list.  

**2. algorithm_bubble_optimized.py:** bubble sort optimized version of the same algorithm.  

**3. insertion_sort.py :** insertion sort algorithm also using random generated numbers.  

**4. selection_sort.py :** Selection sort algorithm also using random generated numbers. Now improved with ascending or descending order.

**5. shell_sort.py :** Shell sort sorting algorithm.

**6. merge_sort.py :** Merge sort sorting algorithm.

**7. counting_sort.py :** Counting sort sorting algorithm - cumulative counts of number of occurrences of each unique element in an auxiliary array -.

**8. quick_sort.py :** Quick sort algorithm is a divide and conquer approach, we divide the main array into sub arrays, using the rightmost element of
the array as pivot element. using recursion.

**9. radix_sort.py :** Radix sort algorithm, sorts by first grouping individual digits of the same place value, then sort according to their increasing -
decreasing order. Uses counting sort as intermediate sorting algorithm.

**10. bucket_sort.py :** Bucket sort algorithm, using insertion sort as a secondary algorithm for sorting.

**11. heap_sort.py :** Heap sort, using complete binary tree data structure, recursive.
